## Project Structure

The project is organized using npm workspaces, with the following structure:

```
kogen/
├── package.json
├── package/
│   └── ui/
│       ├── .env.example
│       ├── package.json
│       └── ...
└── ...
```

## Workspaces

This project uses npm workspaces, which is a feature that allows you to manage multiple packages within a single repository. Workspaces offer several benefits:

1. **Simplified dependency management**: Shared dependencies are hoisted to the root, reducing duplication and saving disk space.
2. **Cross-package development**: You can easily work on and test multiple packages simultaneously.
3. **Consistent versioning**: Ensures all packages use the same version of shared dependencies.

In this project, we have a workspace called `@kogen/kogen-ui` located in the `package/ui` directory.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version X.X.X or higher)
- npm (version X.X.X or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kogen.git
   cd kogen
   ```

2. Set up the environment for the UI package:
   ```
   cp package/ui/.env.example package/ui/.env
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Development

To start the development server for the UI package:

```
npm -w @kogen/kogen-ui run dev
```

This command uses the `-w` flag to specify the workspace package you want to run the script in.

## Testing Production Build

To build and serve the production version of the UI package:

1. Build the production version:
   ```
   npm run -w @kogen/kogen-ui build:prod
   ```

2. Serve the built files:
   ```
   npx serve package/ui/dist
   ```

This README.md provides a more comprehensive overview of your project, including an explanation of workspaces and how to use them in the context of your project. It also includes sections for getting started, development, testing the production build, and placeholders for contributing guidelines and license information.

Remember to replace placeholder information (like version numbers, repository URL, etc.) with the actual details of your project. You may also want to add more specific information about the Kogen project itself, its purpose, and any other relevant details.
