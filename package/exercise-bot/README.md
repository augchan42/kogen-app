# Exercise Bot

Exercise Bot is a keeper that runs on AWS, designed to automatically exercise options on different blockchain networks.

## Overview

This bot supports exercising options on two types of networks:
1. Injective Protocol
2. CosmWasm-compatible chains

The bot determines which network to interact with based on the `CHAIN_ID` environment variable.

## Features

- Automatic detection of the target blockchain network
- Support for Injective Protocol
- Support for CosmWasm-compatible chains
- Designed to run as an AWS Lambda function

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the exercise-bot package:
   ```
   cd package/exercise-bot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your AWS credentials and configure your Lambda function.

4. Set the following environment variables in your AWS Lambda function:
   - `CHAIN_ID`: The ID of the blockchain you're targeting (e.g., "injective-1" for Injective mainnet)
   - Other necessary environment variables (refer to your specific implementation)

## Usage

The main entry point for the bot is the `handler` function in `exercise.js`. This function is designed to be triggered by AWS Lambda on a schedule or in response to specific events.

The bot will automatically determine whether to use the Injective-specific or CosmWasm-compatible exercise function based on the `CHAIN_ID`.

## File Structure

- `exercise.js`: Main entry point that determines which chain-specific function to call
- `exercise-injective.js`: Contains the logic for exercising options on Injective Protocol
- `exercise-cosmwasm.js`: Contains the logic for exercising options on CosmWasm-compatible chains

## Development

To add support for new chains or modify existing functionality:

1. If adding a new chain type, create a new file (e.g., `exercise-newchain.js`) with the chain-specific logic.
2. Update the `handler` function in `exercise.js` to include the new chain type.
3. Implement the necessary logic in your chain-specific file.

## Deployment

Deploy the bot to AWS Lambda using your preferred method (AWS CLI, Serverless Framework, etc.). Ensure that all necessary environment variables are set in your Lambda function configuration.

## Monitoring

Set up CloudWatch Logs to monitor the execution of your Lambda function. You can create alarms to notify you of any errors or unexpected behaviors.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that your AWS Lambda function has the minimum necessary permissions.
- Securely manage any private keys or sensitive information using AWS Secrets Manager or similar services.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch any security vulnerabilities.
