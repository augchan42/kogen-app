# Kogen Chore

The `@kogen/kogen-chore` package is responsible for various maintenance tasks, such as code generation and linting, within the Kogen project.

## Features

- TypeScript code generation using `@cosmwasm/ts-codegen`
- Automated linting and formatting with ESLint and Prettier
- Jest for testing

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version compatible with the project)
- npm (version compatible with the project)

## Installation

1. Navigate to the chore package directory:
   ```
   cd package/chore
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Scripts

### Test

The `test` script currently outputs a placeholder message and exits successfully:
```json:package/chore/package.json
startLine: 6
endLine: 6
```

### Code Generation

The `codegen` script runs TypeScript code generation and then fixes any linting issues in the generated code:
```json:package/chore/package.json
startLine: 7
endLine: 7
```

To run the code generation script:
```
npm run codegen
```
