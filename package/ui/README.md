Certainly! I'll create a README.md for the UI package, making note of the polyfill. Here's the suggested content for the README.md file:

# Kogen UI

This package contains the user interface for the Kogen project, built with React and Vite.

## Features

- React-based UI
- Vite for fast development and building
- Cosmos Kit integration for wallet connections
- Material-UI for styling
- React Router for navigation
- Recoil for state management
- TypeScript support

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version compatible with the project)
- npm (version compatible with the project)

## Installation

1. Navigate to the UI package directory:
   ```
   cd package/ui
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Development

To start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start a Vite development server with hot module replacement.

## Building

For development build:

```
npm run build:dev
```

For production build:

```
npm run build:prod
```

Both commands will create a build in the `dist` directory.

## Preview

To preview the production build:

```
npm run preview
```

## Testing

Currently, there are no tests implemented. The test script exits successfully:

```
npm test
```

## Node Polyfills

This project uses `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` to provide Node.js polyfills for the browser environment. This is particularly useful when working with libraries that depend on Node.js built-in modules.

## Dependencies

Key dependencies include:

- React 18
- Cosmos Kit for wallet integration
- Material-UI for UI components
- React Router for navigation
- Recoil for state management
- Vite for build tooling

For a full list of dependencies, please refer to the `package.json` file.

## Development Dependencies

The project uses TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier for code quality and formatting. Vite is used as the build tool.

This README.md provides an overview of the UI package, including its features, setup instructions, development and build commands, and key dependencies. It also mentions the use of the node polyfills plugin, which is important for developers to be aware of when working on the project.

You may want to customize this further based on any specific requirements or additional information about your UI package.
